# Testing - User Stories 

## GUEST USER :

### 1. As a guest user, I expect the webpage to be easy to navigate.

- The navigation bar is a persistent feature on every page and has been designed to be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across all devices and resolutions. On mobile devices, the navigation bar automatically transitions to a hamburger menu, providing easy access to all additional pages and sections. This intuitive design enables users to navigate the site with ease, regardless of their device or screen size.

### 2. As a guest user, I expect the purpose of the website to be explained right away.

The introduction section of the website is designed to quickly convey the purpose and essence of the platform, allowing users to assess whether it is suitable for their interests within a brief timeframe. Following this initial section, a visually appealing divider image featuring a selection of fresh and tasty cocktails is prominently displayed. However, in consideration of mobile device users, this image is strategically hidden from view to prevent clutter and ensure an unobstructed user experience on smaller screens, ensuring that the content remains easily accessible and readable.

The registration page allows users to create a personal account, giving them access to a secure area where they can manage their own cocktail recipes. Upon registration, users can choose a unique username and password, which will serve as their credentials for logging into the platform. The whole process is seamless and efficient.

### 4. As a guest user, I anticipate being able to easily browse through recipes without the need to create an account.

The cocktails section displays a collection of cocktail recipes, each presented in a visually appealing card format. The cards feature a cocktail icon, the drink's name, category, and description, as well as a brief summary of its ingredients and characteristics. Each card is linked to a detailed view of the cocktail, where users can learn more about its ingredients, preparation instructions, and other details. This section allows users to browse through and read all the cocktail recipes without needing to create an account, making it easy to discover new recipes to try.
