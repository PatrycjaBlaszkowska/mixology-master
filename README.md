## INTRODUCTION 

Welcome to my third project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course.
The main purpose of this project is to build a fully functioning, full-stack web application.

Mixology Master is a free-to-use cocktail recipe platform. 

The user can browse through available cocktail recipes without an account.
The user can also add their own recipes after registering and logging into their account.
All logged-in users can download a free guide on how to add their own recipe.

### Thank you for visiting Mixology Master!

## UXD – User Experience Design

A user experience designer, Jesse James Garrett, introduced five UX design elements in his book The Elements of User Experience.
In the book, he explains the steps of user experience projects and what UX designers should consider at each stage.
This is where most of my planning process steps came from.

The 5 planes of UX are as below:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## The Strategy Plane

### Creator Goals :

- As a creator, I want my webpage to be user-friendly.
- As a creator, I want my webpage to be fully responsive.
- As a creator, I want my webpage to be functional.
- As a creator, I want my webpage to be easy to navigate.
- As a creator, I want the purpose of my webpage to be clear.
- As a creator, I aim to foster repeat visits to my webpage from users.

### User stories :

**GUEST USER** :

- As a guest user, I expect the webpage to be easy to navigate.
- As a guest user, I expect the purpose of the website to be explained right away.
- As a guest user, I expect the registration process to be seamless and efficient.
- As a guest user, I anticipate being able to easily browse through recipes without the need to create an account.

**LOGGED-IN USER**

- As a logged-in user, I expect the webpage to be easy to navigate.
- As a logged-in user, I expect the login process to be seamless and efficient.
- As a logged user, I expect the user dashboard to include all important information and functions.
- As a logged user, I anticipate being able to add and manage my own recipes.
- As a logged user, I anticipate being able to delete my account.

**User stories are based on online research and my relatives experiance.**

## The Scope Plane

The planning process allowed me to prioritize the implementation of features based on their importance to my user stories, 
enabling me to identify which ones could be completed within the given deadline and which ones would need to be postponed for later implementation.

#### Features implemented upon webpage release :

- Introduction on the homepage providing information on the art of bartending.
- Page dedicated to recipes featuring all available recipes for users.
- Verification system for users.
- Ability for logged-in users to create and manage their own recipes.
- User-friendly navigation bar for easy access to different pages.
- Footer with links to social media platforms.
- Contact form for users to communicate with the website owner/admin.
- User dashboard for account management, recipe creation, and guide downloads.
- Search bar functionality to help users browse through a variety of available recipes.

#### Fatures planned to implement later :

- Two-step authentication.
- Password retrieval.
- Option for logged-in users to upload an image of the cocktail when submitting a recipe.
- Ability to search for cocktails based on available ingredients.
