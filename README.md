## INTRODUCTION 

Welcome to my third project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course.
The main purpose of this project is to build a fully functioning, full-stack web application.

Mixology Master is a free-to-use cocktail recipe platform.Â 

The user can browse through available cocktail recipes without an account.
The user can also add their own recipes after registering and logging into their account.
All logged-in users can download a free guide on how to add their own recipe.
