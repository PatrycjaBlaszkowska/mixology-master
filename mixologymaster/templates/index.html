            <p>What cocktail spec means?</p>
            <p>
                A cocktail spec, short for specification, is a detailed and precise recipe for making a specific cocktail. <br>
                It includes the exact measurements of each ingredient, the specific type and brand of alcohol or mixer to use, <br>
                the method of preparation, and any garnishes or finishing touches to ensure consistency in the drink's flavor and presentation.

            <p>Is bartender kit needed to make cocktails?</p>
            <p>
                It is not required to have a bartender kit to make cocktails, but having one can make the process easier and more efficient. <br>
                A basic bartender kit typically includes essential tools such as a shaker, jigger, strainer, muddler, and bar spoon. <br>
                These tools can help you measure ingredients accurately, mix drinks properly, and strain out any unwanted particles.
